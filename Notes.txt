# Graph Notes

Tree Edge: It is a edge which is present in tree obtained after applying DFS on the graph. All the Green edges are tree edges.
Forward Edge: It is an edge (u, v) such that v is descendant but not part of the DFS tree. Edge from 1 to 8 is a forward edge.
Back edge: It is an edge (u, v) such that v is ancestor of edge u but not part of DFS tree. Edge from 6 to 2 is a back edge. Presence of back edge indicates a cycle in directed graph.
Cross Edge: It is a edge which connects two node such that they do not have any ancestor and a descendant relationship between them. Edge from node 5 to 4 is cross edge.
